# Diagnosis

### Description
A model that tries to diagnose a condition based on the symptoms selected. 
Initialy this model was made to be used as a standalone windows application using tkinter to render the UI.
I adapted the model slightly so that it can be implemented inside other web based applications.

## Installation
It is recommended that you use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.
For the purposes of this project I used pipenv.

1. Clone this repo `git clone <repo url> `.
2. Change your directory to the newly downloaded repo folder `cd diagnosis`.
3. Install the dependencies  `pipenv install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Activate the virtual enviroment `pipenv shell`.
5. Run the model `python prediction-model.py`.
6. To exit the virtual enviroment `exit`.

## Model Info
The dataset for this project was collected from a study of university of Columbia.
The study was performed at New York Presbyterian Hospital during 2004.
